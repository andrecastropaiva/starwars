# Starwars MongoDB - Data Engineering Project


## Instructions
The data in this database has been pulled from https://swapi.dev/. As well as 'people', the API has data on starships. In Python, pull data on all available starships from the API. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection. Use functions at the very least!



## Requirements
- Good coding principles (code commenting, follow PEP 8 standards, code readability)
- Use functional programming (functions) OR object-oriented programming (classes).
- Use Test Driven Development (write tests to test code)
